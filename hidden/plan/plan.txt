Step-by-Step Implementation

1. Tab Manager with Grouping and Search
UI Design: Create a popup with a list of open tabs, grouping options, and a search bar.
Functionality: Use the chrome.tabs API to get the list of open tabs, allow grouping, and implement search functionality.

2. Productivity Tracker
UI Design: Design a dashboard to display time spent on different websites.
Functionality: Use background scripts to track active tab times and store data in chrome.storage. Display this data on the dashboard.

3. Ad Blocker with Custom Filters
UI Design: Provide an interface for users to add custom filters and view blocked ads.
Functionality: Use the chrome.webRequest API to block requests from known ad domains and allow users to add custom domains.

4. Screenshot and Annotation Tool
UI Design: Create a toolbar for capturing screenshots and adding annotations.
Functionality: Use the chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab API for screenshots and a canvas element for annotations.

5. Bookmark Organizer with Tags and Notes
UI Design: Design a bookmark manager with tagging and note-taking capabilities.
Functionality: Use the chrome.bookmarks API to manage bookmarks, add tags, and notes, and implement a search function.

6. Content Translator and Summarizer
UI Design: Provide a popup for translation and summarization options.
Functionality: Use translation APIs (like Google Translate) and NLP models for summarization. Integrate these services to process selected text or entire pages.


7. Privacy Protector
UI Design: Create a control panel for privacy settings (blocking trackers, deleting cookies, spoofing user-agent).
Functionality: Use the chrome.webRequest API to block trackers, chrome.cookies API to manage cookies, and modify user-agent strings.
